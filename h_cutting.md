# Cut Plan (Phase-Based)

## Goal
- LBM: ~58.9 kg
- Goal BF%: 22%
- Goal weight: ~166 lbs (~75.5 kg)

---

## Phase 1 – Aggressive Cut
**Goal:** Drop fat quickly while strength training to preserve lean mass.  
- **Duration:** 8–10 weeks  
- **Calories:** **1500 kcal/day** (re-feed 1× every 2 weeks at ~TDEE)  
- **Macros:** ~120–140 g protein, fats ≥50 g, rest carbs  
- **Expected loss:** ~0.5–0.55 kg/week → ~4–5 kg fat lost in 2 months  

---

## Phase 2 – Moderate Cut
**Goal:** Slow the rate slightly to reduce adaptation and keep energy up.  
- **Duration:** 8–10 weeks  
- **Calories:** **1600–1675 kcal/day** (still 1 re-feed every 2 weeks)  
- **Macros:** ~120 g protein, fats ≥50 g  
- **Expected loss:** ~0.35–0.4 kg/week → ~3–4 kg fat lost  

---

## Phase 3 – Finish & Transition
**Goal:** Reach target BF% and reverse diet into maintenance.  
- **Duration:** ~6–8 weeks  
- **Calories:** Start at **1700–1750 kcal/day** and raise by 50–100 kcal/week until maintenance (~2050 kcal)  
- **Refeeds:** Optional — used more for psychological break than metabolism  
- **Expected loss:** ~2–3 kg fat, minimal lean mass loss  

---

## Timeline Summary
- **Total Duration:** ~22–24 weeks instead of 29–31 weeks  
- **Total Fat Loss:** ~9–12 kg from Phase 1 & 2, plus ~3 kg from Phase 3 → full 15 kg goal hit  

---

## Notes
- Cluster carbs **around workouts** to maintain performance.
- Use refeed days for heavier training sessions.
- Track progress every 2 weeks (weight, photos, waist measurement).
- Adjust calories only if fat loss stalls for 3+ weeks.
